",Not provided,0.85,67,"The candidate's profile was evaluated against the job requirements based on the specified criteria:

-   **Must-Have Requirements (Score out of 35):** The candidate has 'Documentation' as a responsibility (strong match for documenting design processes - 7/7). Skills like Python, Java, C++ support scripting potential (partial match for scripting - 5/5). Responsibilities include 'Technical Support', 'Troubleshooting', 'System Monitoring', suggesting some technical issue handling, but evidence for 'expert knowledge of software development processes', 'solid experience in testing and evaluating current networking systems', or 'experience with rapid development cycles in a web-based environment' is weak based on the 'Big Data Analyst' role and profile details (estimated 5/35 for processes/systems/web combined). Total Must-Have Score: 7 + 5 + 5 = 17/35.
-   **Nice-to-Have Requirement (Score out of 5):** Candidate lists DBMS, RDBMS, and database-related tools/services, indicating knowledge of relational databases (good match - 4/5). No evidence for HTML5, CSS3, CMS, or specific web frameworks mentioned (0/5). Total Nice-to-Have Score: 4/5.
-   **Years of Experience Required (Score out of 10):** The job requires 5+ years as an engineer of software/networking platforms and 7+ years with Java, Python, C++ (professional + academic). Candidate has ~4.5 years of professional experience as a Big Data Analyst. This does not clearly meet the 5+ years engineering requirement in the specified domain (estimated 2/5 for engineering). Candidate graduated in 2019, implying ~4 years academic + ~4.5 years professional = ~8.5 years with languages, meeting the 7+ years language requirement (estimated 5/5 for languages). Total Years of Experience Score: 2 + 5 = 7/10.
-   **Skills Required (Score out of 15):** Candidate lists Java, Python, C++ and meets the academic+professional duration requirement (estimated 6/6 points for languages). Lists 'Documentation' responsibility (estimated 2/2 points). Skills and responsibilities suggest some ability in scripting via languages (estimated 2/3 points). Evidence for 'expert knowledge of software development processes', 'testing/evaluating networking systems', and 'test automation' is weak (estimated 1/4 points). Total Skills Score: 6 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11/15.
-   **Education Required (Score out of 5):** Bachelor's degree is preferred. Candidate has a B.Tech, which is a Bachelor's degree. Meets requirement (5/5).
-   **Certifications Required (Score out of 5):** Not Specified. Requirement met (5/5).
-   **Location (Score out of 5):** Not Specified. Requirement met (5/5).
-   **Current Position (Score out of 5):** Candidate is a 'Big Data Analyst'. The job requirements (networking systems, software engineer, web environment, test automation) imply a different type of engineering role. Not a direct match (2/5).
-   **Current Company (Score out of 5):** Not Specified. Requirement met (5/5).
-   **Additional Criteria (Score out of 10):** Profile provides some evidence of finding/fixing issues via troubleshooting/support (partial match - 3/5 for motivation). Evidence for being a 'highly skilled software engineer' in the context of this job's focus is weak (estimated 3/5 for skill level). No evidence of desire for continued professional growth (0/5). Total Additional Criteria Score: 3 + 3 + 0 = 6/10.

**Summary:** The candidate has relevant language experience, education, and documentation skills. However, they fall short on the required duration and specific type of engineering experience (networking, testing, web environment, test automation) outlined in the core requirements.

Trade Marketing",0.416666667,41,"Evaluation based on the provided job requirements and candidate profile:

**Must-Have Requirements (Score: 9/35):** The candidate lists 'Software Development' and skills like Python which can be used for scripting, but lacks explicit mentions or strong evidence of expert knowledge in software development *processes*, solid experience in testing/evaluating networking systems, proven ability to document design processes, experience with rapid development cycles in a web-based environment, and strong ability in test automation. Significant gaps exist in these critical areas.

**Nice-to-Have Requirements (Score: 2/5):** The candidate lists HTML and CSS, showing some proficiency with web technologies. 'Hive' is listed, which is related to SQL in a Big Data context, but working knowledge of relational databases and ORM is not clear. Web application frameworks mentioned in the job description are not listed.

**Years of Experience Required (Score: 5/10):** The candidate has approximately 6 years of professional experience (June 2018 to current), which meets the requirement of 'Five or more years' as a software engineer. However, the requirement for 'Seven or more years experience (professional and academic)' with Java, Python, and C++ is unlikely to be met, as professional experience is less than 7 years, Java is not listed as a skill, and academic experience duration is unclear.

**Skills Required (Score: 5/15):** Candidate lists 'Software Development', Python, and C/C++. These align partially with the required skills (Software development processes, Python, C++). However, key required skills like Java (7+ years), testing/evaluating networking systems, documenting design processes, and test automation are either missing or not explicitly demonstrated at the required level/duration.

**Education Required (Score: 5/5):** The candidate holds a B.Tech degree, which is equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, meeting the job's 'Preferred' education requirement.

**Certifications Required (Score: 5/5):** The job does not specify any required certifications, and the candidate profile does not list any. This is a match as no certifications are mandatory.

**Location (Score: 5/5):** The job location is not specified, and the candidate's location is listed as N/A. This is a match as location is not a constraint from the job description.

**Current Position (Score: 1/5):** The candidate's current position is 'Software Developer (Machine Learning Engineer)'. While it is a software role, the 'Machine Learning' focus may not align directly with the job's likely emphasis on networking systems testing and test automation. The listed responsibilities under this position seem to be incorrectly parsed (Trade Marketing, Brand Visibility) and were disregarded for this evaluation.

**Current Company (Score: 1/5):** The candidate is currently at 'Axis Bank Limited'. While a large institution, the specific relevance of the company's focus to the job's requirements (networking platform engineering, testing) is low compared to companies specializing in these areas.

**Additional Criteria (Score: 3/10):** The candidate's listed skills suggest some capability as a software engineer, partially meeting the 'Highly skilled software engineer' criterion (Score 3/5). However, motivation for finding/fixing issues or desire for professional growth is not evident from the profile (Score 0/5).

**Overall Assessment:** The candidate possesses foundational software development skills and meets basic criteria like education and total experience years. However, there are significant deficiencies in the core technical requirements crucial for this role, particularly around networking systems testing, test automation, specific language experience (Java is missing, Python/C++ experience duration is likely less than required), and documentation. The candidate's current role focus also seems less aligned with the specific technical domain of the job. The score reflects a candidate who is not a strong match for the specialized technical requirements of this position."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27,"Candidate evaluation based on the provided job requirements and candidate profile:

-   **Must-Have Requirements (Weight: 35):** Candidate's profile focuses on iOS development (internship responsibilities) and Machine Learning skills. The job requires expert knowledge in general software development processes, solid experience in networking systems testing, ability to document design processes, experience in rapid web-based development cycles, and strong scripting/test automation skills. The candidate demonstrates minimal overlap with 'Requirement Analysis', 'Performance Optimization', and 'Bug Fixing' which touch on software processes but lack the depth and specific domains required (networking, web, automation, scripting). No evidence of the other must-haves. **Score: 5/35**
-   **Nice-to-Have Requirement (Weight: 5):** The job lists working knowledge of relational databases/ORM/SQL, proficiency with web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, CMS), and web application frameworks (Wicket, GWT, Spring MVC). The candidate's skills (ML, Tableau, Time Series) and responsibilities (iOS) do not align with these nice-to-have requirements. **Score: 0/5**
-   **Years of Experience Required (Weight: 10):** The job requires five or more years as a software/networking platforms engineer and seven or more years (professional and academic) with Java, Python, and C++. The candidate has only 9 months of experience as an *Intern* (Jan 2019 - Sep 2019) in iOS development. There is no mention of experience with Java, Python, or C++. This is a significant mismatch. **Score: 0/10**
-   **Skills Required (Weight: 15):** The required skills are specific (expert software dev processes, solid networking systems testing, 7+ years Java/Python/C++, documenting design, strong scripting/automation). Candidate lists ML, Regression, Tableau, Time Series, and iOS-related skills/responsibilities. There is no match with the core technical skills required for the role. **Score: 0/15**
-   **Education Required (Weight: 5):** The job prefers a Bachelor's degree or equivalent, but does not strictly require it. The candidate has a B.Tech in IT (graduating 2020), which meets the preferred educational qualification. **Score: 5/5**
-   **Certifications Required (Weight: 5):** No certifications are required for the job. The candidate profile does not list any, which is not a disadvantage as none were required. **Score: 5/5**
-   **Location (Weight: 5):** Location is not specified in the job requirements. It is not a factor in the evaluation. **Score: 5/5**
-   **Current Position (Weight: 5):** The candidate's only listed professional experience is a 9-month internship ending in Sep 2019. The job likely requires a mid-to-senior level engineer (5+ years experience). The intern position held several years ago does not align with the expected level or recency. **Score: 1/5**
-   **Current Company (Weight: 5):** Current company is not specified in the job requirements. It is not a factor in the evaluation. **Score: 5/5**
-   **Additional Criteria (Weight: 10):** The job mentions being a highly skilled software engineer, motivated in finding/fixing technical issues, and desire for professional growth. The candidate's limited internship responsibilities mention 'Bug Fixing', which partially aligns with finding/fixing issues, but there is insufficient information to assess high skill level or motivation for growth in the context of *this* job's requirements. **Score: 1/10**

**Overall Assessment:** The candidate's profile is a poor fit for this role, primarily due to the significant lack of required experience (both total years and specific languages/domains), must-have technical skills (networking, web, automation), and the level/type of their past position (intern vs. 5+ years engineer). While they meet the preferred education and satisfy criteria that were not specified, the core technical and experience requirements are unmet."

Their scripting/automation experience is in the Data/ML domain.
-   **Nice-to-Have Requirements (Score: 0/5):** None of the nice-to-have skills (databases/SQL, HTML/CSS/CMS, web frameworks) are mentioned in the candidate's profile.
-   **Years of Experience Required (Score: 0/10):** The candidate has approximately 4 years and 9 months of professional experience as a Business Analyst. This does not meet the requirement of 5+ years as a software/networking engineer, nor the 7+ years requirement for Java, Python, and C++ experience (Java and C++ are not listed; Python experience level is not specified but unlikely 7+ years).
-   **Skills Required (Score: 0/15):** The candidate's listed skills (Data Analysis, ML, R, SAS, etc.) and responsibilities do not match the core technical skills required for the job (Software development processes, networking testing, Java, Python, C++, documenting design processes, scripting/automation in the job's domain).
-   **Education Required (Score: 5/5):** The candidate has an M.Sc in Statistics, which meets or exceeds the implied preference for a Bachelor's degree or equivalent.
-   **Certifications Required (Score: 5/5):** No certifications are required, and none are listed. This criterion is met as no requirement exists.
-   **Location (Score: 5/5):** Location is not specified in the job requirements or the candidate profile, so there is no mismatch.
-   **Current Position (Score: 0/5):** The candidate's current position is 'Business Analyst', which is significantly different from the implied technical Software/Networking Engineer role of the job.
-   **Current Company (Score: 5/5):** The current company is not specified in the job requirements, so there is no mismatch.
-   **Additional Criteria (Score: 0/10):** While the candidate's profile suggests motivation (career objective, responsibilities), it is not aligned with the requirements for a 'highly skilled software engineer' motivated by technical issues and code quality in the context of this specific job role.

Overall, the candidate's profile is a poor fit for this specific job opening due to significant mismatches in required experience level, technical skills (especially Java, C++, networking, specific software processes), must-have requirements, and current role alignment. The candidate appears better suited for Data Science or ML-focused roles rather than a core Software/Networking Engineering position."

Overall Justification: The candidate's profile is a poor fit for the job requirements. Their entire professional background, skills, and education are centered around administrative, accounting, and insurance/underwriting roles, which are completely different from the required software and networking engineering domain. They lack experience in all must-have and core technical skill areas, and their years of experience are not relevant to the required field. The minimal score is derived only from criteria that were not specified as mandatory requirements in the job description (certifications and location) and a token point for education not being strictly mandatory, despite being in an irrelevant field. The candidate scores 0 on all the most important criteria (Must-Have Requirements, Years of Experience, Skills, Current Position)."

The core skills, extensive work history (approximately 18 years), education (Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting), and career objective are all centered around the accounting field.

Evaluation Breakdown:

*   **Must-Have Requirements (0/35):** The candidate lacks the required expert knowledge of software development processes, solid experience in testing/evaluating networking systems, experience with rapid development cycles in a web-based environment, and strong ability in scripting/test automation. While documentation skill is listed, its context in the profile is accounting, not software/networking design processes.
*   **Nice-to-Have Requirement (0/5):** None of the desired skills such as knowledge of databases (ORM, SQL), web technologies (HTML5, CSS3), or web frameworks are present in the profile.
*   **Years of Experience Required (0/10):** The candidate has significant professional experience (~18 years), but it is entirely in accounting and related financial roles, not as an engineer of software or networking platforms. There is no evidence of the required 7+ years experience with Java, Python, or C++.
*   **Skills Required (0/15):** The candidate's listed skills are almost exclusively accounting-related and do not match the required skills in software development processes, networking systems testing, specific languages (Java, Python, C++, scripting, test automation), or documentation in the context of software/networking design.
*   **Education Required (3/5):** The candidate holds a Bachelor's degree, which meets the preferred education level. However, the major (Accounting) is not relevant to the engineering discipline required for this role.
*   **Certifications Required (0/5):** No specific certifications are required. The candidate holds an Ohio Notary Public certification, which is irrelevant to the job requirements.
*   **Location (5/5):** Location is specified in the candidate profile, and the job description does not specify a required location, thus this criterion is met.
*   **Current Position (0/5):** The candidate's current position is listed as 'Staff Accountant', which is entirely different from the required engineering role. Note: The profile also confusingly includes sections titled 'responsibilities' and 'job_position_name: Senior iOS Engineer' at the very end, which contradict the detailed work history and skill list. Even if considered, 'Senior iOS Engineer' is a specific development niche and the listed responsibilities do not confirm experience with the specific technologies (networking, Java, Python, C++, web environment, scripting, automation) required by the job description.
*   **Current Company (0/5):** The current company is specified in the candidate profile, but no specific company is required in the job description.
*   **Additional Criteria (0/10):** The additional criteria relate to being a highly skilled software engineer, motivation in finding technical issues in code, and desire for growth in the relevant technical field. These are not supported by the candidate's accounting-focused profile or work history.

In summary, the candidate's professional background, skills, and experience are a fundamental mismatch for the software and networking engineer position. The few potentially relevant terms (like 'documentation' or the contradictory iOS sections) are either in the wrong context or do not provide sufficient evidence of meeting the specific, stringent technical requirements of the role."
